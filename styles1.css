/*CSS is a ruled based language-- you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied 
to particular elements on your web page. 
The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some 
CSS rules we want to apply, this time we'll focus on linking CSS from the head of our document.
We can target and style an HTML element*/
