  <h1> Responsive images using picture tag </h1>
  <picture> <!-- acts like a wrapper -->
    <source media="(max-width:799px)" <!-- here it goes the width we want --> " src="path-to-the-file-if-the-condition-is-true" />
    <soruce media="(min-with:800px)" src="path-to-the-file-if-this-media-condition-is-true"
    <img src="default-path-we-want" alt="accurate image description"/>

  <h2> Why can't we do this using CSS? </h2>
  <p>
  Whenever a web browser starts to load a page, it starts by preloading any images before the main parser
  has started to load and interpret CSS and JavaScript pages. Although this mechanism is useful for reducing loading 
  web pages time, doesnt come in handy when talking about responsive design, hence the need to implement solutions like srcset.
  For example, we couldnt load the <img> element, then detect the viewport width with JavaScript, and then dinamically change the 
  image source to a smaller one if desired. By then, the original image would already have been loaded and you would load the 
  small image as well , which is even worse in responsive images terms.
